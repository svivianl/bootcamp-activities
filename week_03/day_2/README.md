# DOM Events

e.key = A
e.keyCode = 65

**keydown** ANY key is pressed
**keypress**  ANY key except Shift, Fn, CapsLock is in pressed position. (Fired continously.)

# Window .onload()

The load event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.

$(document).ready fires when the DOM is ready, while window.onload only fires after all images and other resources to be loaded
