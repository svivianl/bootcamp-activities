# Connecting PostgreSQL tfrom JavaScript

Install drivers from [here](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres).
The `pg` driver is in the `package.json` in this [folder](../../).

Once you have the pg module installed, read and understand the [Getting Started](https://node-postgres.com/) example in the documentation. The additional information about things like Connection Pooling are important but not for simple apps. You may read this but knowing about it at this stage is not necessary.

Research and/or Discuss:

What other information does the result object returned from query contain?
Why does the query function take in an array of arguments?
Is there any resemblance to the mongo driver that you used in Week 3, in this activity?
What is this new keyword that you see being used to create the client? You may not have seen this before.
