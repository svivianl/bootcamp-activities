# REST

REST is a set of conventions and practices in web development that deals with accessing and manipulating resources over HTTP.

A resource can be an abstraction of an object or data. In practice resources are referenced using a URL (Uniform **Resource** Locator).

We can perform various operations on these resources (create, delete, modify) using the different HTTP methods.

A resource can be any entity (or collection of entities) referred to by its resource identifier. It means that it is an abstraction for a document or image, or a temporal service

## Resource Identifier

When you identify a resource, you must choose a name for it. The name is typically the name of the object type, plural, all lower case, and often with words separated with hyphens (unless it is a singular resource, which we'll get to later).
